# 🏥 Hospital Management System (HMS)

A web-based Hospital Management System that includes a **login page** to authenticate users based on username and password. This project demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration with local validation for a hospital management application.

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔑 **User Authentication** – Login using predefined credentials
* 🖥️ **Responsive Design** – Clean and intuitive UI
* 🌄 **Custom Background** – Full-screen background image for a professional look
* 💻 **Client-Side Validation** – Simple username and password check (hardcoded)
* 🚀 **Offline Use** – No backend server required (local path for image)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements

* Modern Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
* Local HTML file access (for development purposes)

### ▶️ Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the `login.html` file in your browser
3. Use the default credentials to log in:

| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| `jeevi`  | `123`    |

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Login Authentication**: The login page validates the credentials (`jeevi` & `123`) and redirects to the main system page (`index.html`).
2. **Error Handling**: If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed.

## 🛠️ Customization

* Update the background image path as per your project structure
* Extend the login validation with a real backend for user management
* Enhance security by encrypting passwords
